# Project Title: Churn Prediction in Telecom using Machine Learning

Overview: This project develops a machine learning model to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. It utilizes feature engineering columns to predict the customer churn.
Dataset Source: The project utilizes the Telco Customer Churn dataset available on Kaggle.
Key Features:
Employs machine learning techniques for churn prediction.
Leverages a publicly available Kaggle blastchar telecom churn dataset.
Incorporates feature engineering methods such as:
Engagement Score: A composite score based on monthly charges, contract length, and tech support.
CustomerFrequency: Measures the frequency of tech support usage.
Long Term ContractStability: Measures churn based on contract duration.
Aims for deployment as a web application for practical implementation.

Potential Future Enhancements:
Temporal and Sequential Analysis for more nuanced churn prediction over time.
Real-Time Prediction and Alert systems for customer service teams.
Testing the model's transferability across different datasets and industries.
Integration of a recommendation engine for customer retention strategies.
